# Dotfiles

My configuration files and user preferences.

## License

Generally, it is considered that the content of the dotfiles is governed by the terms and conditions of the software licenses to which they belong.

## History

Back in 1995, when I first started using Linux, it wasn’t common to back up configuration files. I didn’t care about backups until 1998, mainly because reapplying my settings after reinstalling the system was a tedious task.

I decided to begin from scratch and keep my configuration files organized after earning my engineering degree in 2024. Then I discovered I had several gigabytes of dotfiles. After spending weeks gathering and cleaning them up, I started this repository to reorganize everything.

To simplify things, I chose to remove configurations for software I no longer use and set up clean Linux installations on my personal computers to apply the snippets I found interesting and useful.

## What I use

  - **nerdfonts** as my font provider. [Here is the link.](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
  - **zsh** as my command interpreter.
  - **oh my zsh** as an improvement on zsh.
  - **vim** as my terminal text editor.
  - **vimdiff** as my terminal diff viewer.
  - **vscodium** as my GUI text editor and diff viewer.
  - **git** as my version control system.
  - **editorconfig** as a simple text formatting tool.
  - **screen** as my default window multiplexer.
  - **tmux** as a fancy alternative for a window multiplexer.
  - **mc** as my terminal file manager.

## Word of caution:

This repository is public as a way not to lose access to my own configuration files and user preferences, not for collaborative purposes, as I do not intend to maintain a history or ensure the consistency of this repository over time.

  - Read the files before using.
  - Extract snippets to adapt to your own dotfiles.
  - Do not use this repository on your own computers.
  - Do not fork this repository unless you know how to use it.
